## What is sales tax?

- A percentage of the total sales price of taxable goods and services.
- Sales taxes are imposed by states and local areas such as cities, counties, and other special taxing districts
- There is no federal sales tax in the U.S.
- Sales taxes are **consumption taxes**, which means they are charged in conjunction with a purchase of applicable products or services. 
- **Each state has its own sales tax rules and laws.** 
  - Thus, every state your business has nexus in will have its own set of rules and laws that you’ll need to ensure compliance with.
- The rules of sales tax can vary significantly between states, including aspects such as:
  - Which types of products and services are considered taxable;
  - Percentage of sales tax to be charged; and
  - Timing, frequency, and deadlines of required sales tax return filings.
- **five states in the U.S. do not have a sales tax:** 
  - Alaska
  - Delaware
  - Montana
  - New Hampshire
  - Oregon

## What is sales tax nexus?

- **Nexus** is a significant connection to or presence within a state. 
- If you have nexus in a state that means your business is required to be compliant with that state’s sales tax rules and laws. 
- **Your business is required to collect sales tax in the states you have nexus**.
- You’ll also need to report and file taxes according to that state’s tax laws.

## What factors determine sales tax nexus?

- How do you know if you have nexus within a state? There are multiple considerations you need to be aware of.

### Location-based nexus

- Your business will have nexus **everywhere you have a business presence**, even if the presence is only temporary (such as an expo or trade show). 
- This can include the location of your:
  - Home or office
  - Brick-and-mortar stores
  - Sales showrooms or sample rooms
  - Headquarters or satellite offices
  - Repair shops or places your products are altered
  - Manufacturing or production facility
  - Warehouse or inventory storage (such as a [3PL fulfillment center](https://www.shipmonk.com/))
  - Employees, contractors, installers, or traveling sales representatives
  - Affiliates
  - Drop-shipping relationships or third-party distribution
  - Events or trade shows you sell at
- **If you sell on Amazon via their** [**FBA services**](https://www.shipmonk.com/fulfillment-services/fba-prep-services)**, your business has nexus within every state where Amazon is storing your inventory.** 
- Your business is required to collect sales tax from buyers whenever the products solds are being shipped to a state in which you have nexus.

#### Example of a location-based nexus

- You operate in Florida. Office is there, warehouse is there.
- No business presence in any other state.
  - If you ship to Florida, you must collect sales tax.
  - If you ship to customers outside of Florida, you don't need to collect sales tax.
    - What about other countries?
- Business grows, and hires a third party fulfilment company in California and New York.
  - Business now must collect sales tax on products shipped to those states as well.

### Economic nexus

- newer concept, largely inspired by the current landscape of e-commerce.
- Applies when your business has a significant economic presence within a state, 
  - the thresholds for which are based on state rules. 
- If you sell above a certain amount of **revenue or transactions** within a state, then you are required to collect sales tax from customers in that state. 
- As of now, about half of the states that impose sales tax have requirements based on whether your business exceeds a specific threshold of sales. 
  - More states will be following suit and will begin to pass updated economic nexus laws. 
- Currently, the most common thresholds are:
  - If you sell over **$100,000 in annual revenue** within a state; or
  - If you sell over **200 transactions** within a state.
- sales taxes laws and rules vary state by state. (We can’t stress this enough!)

## How can I ensure my business is sales tax compliant?

- There are multiple steps to ensuring your business is sales tax compliant:
  - You must determine **where** your business has sales tax nexus.
  - You must confirm whether some or all of your **products** are subject to sales tax.
  - You must legally comply by **registering** for a sales tax permit in your nexus states.
  - You must confirm whether other fees such as **shipping** and **gift wrapping** are subject to sales tax in your nexus states.
  - You must **collect** sales tax from buyers in those nexus states. *(Note: You’ll want to ensure this is properly set up and automated within your ecommerce sales channels, marketplaces, or online shopping carts.)*
  - You must **report** the sales tax you have collected, **file** your sales tax returns, and make the required payments.

## Are my products taxable?

- most tangible products are taxable in the U.S. if they are not considered necessities.

### Origin-based vs. destination-based sales tax collection

- Generally, states will require you to collect sales tax based on either origin or destination. This is also known as **sales tax sourcing**.

#### Origin-based tax sourcing

- you’ll need to collect sales tax in the state your business is located in.
- This means you would charge sales tax at the rate required by the state your business has a presence in (i.e. where your home, store, office, headquarters, or warehouse is located). 

#### destination-based sales tax sourcing

- Most states use destination-based sales tax collection
- you’ll need to charge the sales tax at the rate required by the state your buyer’s “ship to” address is located
- This gets more complicated because you’ll need to charge the rates required by the state, county, city, and applicable local sales tax rates based on your buyer’s shipping address.

> Note: For e-commerce businesses, you’ll generally be collecting sales tax based on rates required for the “ship to” address.

### Is shipping taxable?

- Some states consider shipping fees to be a taxable component of the transaction
  - especially in e-commerce
- In those states, you would be required to collect sales tax on the shipping fee charged to your customer. 
  - This means if a customer’s shopping cart total is $50 and they select a $15 shipping option, the taxable amount would be $65.
- Some states do not consider shipping to be a taxable charge. 
  - In that case, the customer would only be taxed on their $50 shopping cart total.
- Either way, you should be able to view and/or manage these settings in your online marketplace or shopping cart.

#### Is gift wrapping taxable

- State rules vary, but some states do consider gift-wrapping to be a taxable charge. You should be able to view and/or manage these settings in your online marketplace or shopping cart.

## How does this impact a drop-shipping business?

- Collecting sales tax gets even more complicated with the [dropshipping business model](https://www.shipmonk.com/blog/what-is-dropshipping-and-is-it-best-for-your-business). 
- Let’s say your business sells graphic-printed tote bags, which are printed and shipped on demand by a third-party company.
- **This dropshipping scenario requires three main components:** 
  1. Your customer purchases the product from you.
  2. You purchase the product from your vendor.
  3. The vendor ships the product to your buyer.
- So the tax rules for this transaction will be based on where you, your customer, and your vendor are located and have sales tax nexus:
  - **If you have nexus in your customer’s state**, you’re required to charge sales tax to your customer.
  - **If your vendor has nexus in your state**, they’re required to charge you sales tax when you purchase from them. *Unless you give them a resale certificate showing that the item you purchased from them is for resale to your customer.*

## Key takeaways about sales tax nexus:

- Nexus is based on your business having either a physical connection or significant economic connection to a state.
- You are required to collect sales tax from buyers whenever you ship a taxable item to a nexus state.
- Nexus in any sales channel will apply to your entire business. You are required to collect sales tax from all buyers in your nexus states regardless of which sales channel the order originates from.
- Sales taxes are governed at the state level, and they vary according to each state’s sales tax laws and rules.
- Once you’ve determined that (1) your business has sales tax nexus in a state and (2) your products are taxable according to that state, then you’ll need to legally collect sales tax on sales to buyers in that state.
- Be sure to register for a sales tax permit before you begin collecting sales tax from buyers. It is unlawful to collect sales tax from buyers if you do not have a valid sales tax permit in that state.
- For e-commerce businesses, you’ll generally be collecting sales tax based on rates required for the “ship to” address.
- You will likely need to set up the correct rates manually. Do not expect the tax settings to be set-up for you automatically by your online shopping cart or the online marketplaces you sell on.
- Shipping charges and gift wrapping charges are considered taxable in some states. Be sure to set this up when you’re setting up sales tax collection rules in your online marketplace or shopping cart.
- If you have nexus in multiple states, you may have different sales tax filing dates for each state.
- Most states require you to report how much sales tax you collected by state as well as within each county, city, and applicable taxing district.
- Always file early! Funds may take a few days to clear, which could result in late fines if they don’t clear by the deadline.
- This can be a very time-consuming process depending on your sales volume, sales channels, and how many nexus states your business has.
- File a sales tax return by the deadline every time, even if you didn’t collect any sales tax within that taxable period.
- Some states offer sales tax discounts. Make sure to double check if this applies to you!
- Dropshipping businesses face more complicated sales tax rules based on three parties: your business, your customer, and the vendor you dropship with. Speak to your drop-shipping vendor(s) to understand who will be responsible for collecting sales tax.
