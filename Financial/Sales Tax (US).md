## What is sales tax?

- A percentage of the total sales price of taxable goods and services.
- Sales taxes are imposed by states and local areas such as cities, counties, and other special taxing districts
- There is no federal sales tax in the U.S.
- Sales taxes are **consumption taxes**, which means they are charged in conjunction with a purchase of applicable products or services. 
- **Each state has its own sales tax rules and laws.** 
  - Thus, every state your business has nexus in will have its own set of rules and laws that you’ll need to ensure compliance with.
- The rules of sales tax can vary significantly between states, including aspects such as:
  - Which types of products and services are considered taxable;
  - Percentage of sales tax to be charged; and
  - Timing, frequency, and deadlines of required sales tax return filings.
- **five states in the U.S. do not have a sales tax:** 
  - Alaska
  - Delaware
  - Montana
  - New Hampshire
  - Oregon

## What is sales tax nexus?

- **Nexus** is a significant connection to or presence within a state. 
- If you have nexus in a state that means your business is required to be compliant with that state’s sales tax rules and laws. 
- **Your business is required to collect sales tax in the states you have nexus**.
- You’ll also need to report and file taxes according to that state’s tax laws.

## What factors determine sales tax nexus?

- How do you know if you have nexus within a state? There are multiple considerations you need to be aware of.

### Location-based nexus

- Your business will have nexus **everywhere you have a business presence**, even if the presence is only temporary (such as an expo or trade show). 
- This can include the location of your:
  - Home or office
  - Brick-and-mortar stores
  - Sales showrooms or sample rooms
  - Headquarters or satellite offices
  - Repair shops or places your products are altered
  - Manufacturing or production facility
  - Warehouse or inventory storage (such as a [3PL fulfillment center](https://www.shipmonk.com/))
  - Employees, contractors, installers, or traveling sales representatives
  - Affiliates
  - Drop-shipping relationships or third-party distribution
  - Events or trade shows you sell at
- **If you sell on Amazon via their** [**FBA services**](https://www.shipmonk.com/fulfillment-services/fba-prep-services)**, your business has nexus within every state where Amazon is storing your inventory.** 
- Your business is required to collect sales tax from buyers whenever the products solds are being shipped to a state in which you have nexus.

#### Example of a location-based nexus

- You operate in Florida. Office is there, warehouse is there.
- No business presence in any other state.
  - If you ship to Florida, you must collect sales tax.
  - If you ship to customers outside of Florida, you don't need to collect sales tax.
    - What about other countries?
- Business grows, and hires a third party fulfilment company in California and New York.
  - Business now must collect sales tax on products shipped to those states as well.

### Economic nexus

- newer concept, largely inspired by the current landscape of e-commerce.
- Applies when your business has a significant economic presence within a state, 
  - the thresholds for which are based on state rules. 
- If you sell above a certain amount of **revenue or transactions** within a state, then you are required to collect sales tax from customers in that state. 
- As of now, about half of the states that impose sales tax have requirements based on whether your business exceeds a specific threshold of sales. 
  - More states will be following suit and will begin to pass updated economic nexus laws. 
- Currently, the most common thresholds are:
  - If you sell over **$100,000 in annual revenue** within a state; or
  - If you sell over **200 transactions** within a state.
- sales taxes laws and rules vary state by state. (We can’t stress this enough!)

## How can I ensure my business is sales tax compliant?

- There are multiple steps to ensuring your business is sales tax compliant:
  - You must determine **where** your business has sales tax nexus.
  - You must confirm whether some or all of your **products** are subject to sales tax.
  - You must legally comply by **registering** for a sales tax permit in your nexus states.
  - You must confirm whether other fees such as **shipping** and **gift wrapping** are subject to sales tax in your nexus states.
