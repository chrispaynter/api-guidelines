# 13 - DDD in the Real World

## Strategic Analysis

- The best starting point for introducing DDD in an organisation is to invest time in understanding the organisation's business strategy and the current state of its systems' architecture.

### Understand the Business Domain

- First identify the company's business domain:
  - What is the organisation's business domain(s)?
  - Who are its customers?
  - What service, or value, does the organisation provide to customers?
  - What companies or products is the organisation competing with?
- These answers will give you a **birds eye view** of the company's high level goals.
- Next "zoom in" to the domain and look for the business building block the organisation employs to achieve its high-level goals: the sub domains.
- A good initial heuristic is the company's org chart
  - Departments and other organisational units.
  - Examine how these units cooperate to allow the company to compete in its business domain.

#### Core subdomains

- To identify these, look for what differentiates it from it's competitors
  - Does the company have a "secret sauce" that its competitors lack?
    - Intellectual property, patents, alrgorithms.
  - Any non technical competitive advantages?

#### Generic Subdomains

- Look for off the shelf solutions
  - Subscription services
  - integration of open software.
