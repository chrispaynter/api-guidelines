## Why Context Maps Are So Essential

- Your map is primary drawn to give your team the solution space perspective it needs to succeed.
- Other teams may not be using DDD, and may not care about your perspective.
  - For example, you may have to interface with a **Big Ball of Mud**.
  - The team maintaining it may not care what direction your project takes
  - As long as you adhere to their API
- However, your map gives your team the insight into where inter-team communication is imperative.
- You may hope for a **Customer-Supplier** relationship with the GBoM team.
  - However, turns out they only intend to provide what they have
  - Forces you into a **Conformist** relationship.
