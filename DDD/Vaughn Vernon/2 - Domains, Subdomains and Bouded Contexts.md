# 2 - Domains, Subdomains and Bouded Contexts

[TOC]

There are three things you have to understand very clearly:

- What your **Domain** is
- What your **Subdomains** are
- What your **Bounded Contexts** are.

## Big Picture

- A Domain, in the broad sense, is what an organisation does and the world it does it in.
- Each business has it's own unique realm of know-how and way of doing things.
- The term *domain model* whilst having the word domain in it, doesn't mean we create on huge model for the organisation's entire domain.
- The whole domain is composed of **subdomains**.
- Using DDD, models are developed in Bounded Contexts.
- Almost every software Domain has multiple Subdomains.
  - Doesn't matter the size of the organisation.
  - There are different functions that make business' successful
  - It's advantageous to think about each of those business functions separately.
