# Entities

## Why we use entities

> Businesses reguarly put too much effort into developing glorified database table editors.

- When CRUD makes sense, languages and frameworks built aroudn it's concepts make the most sense (such as RoR)
- If we apply CRUD to the wrong systems (more complex ones that deserve the precision of DDD), we may regret it.

> When complexity grows, we experience the limitations of poor tool selection.

- CRUD systems can't produce a refined business model by only capturing data.
