# Getting started with DDD

- We primarily want to use DDD in the areas that are most important to the business.
- Don't invest in what can be easily replaced.
- *Invest in the nontrivial, the more complex stuff, the most valuable and important stuff that promises to return the greatest dividends.*
- We call such a model the **Core Domain**.
- In second priority are the *significant* **Supporting Subdomains**.
- These get the most investment.

#### Use DDD to simplify, not to complicate

- Use DDD to model a complex domain in the simplest possible way.
- Never use DDD to make your solution more complex.
