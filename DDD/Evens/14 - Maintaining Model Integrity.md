# 14 - Maintaining Model Integrity

- The most fundamental requirement of a model is that it be internally consistent
  - that its terms always have the same meaning
  - thit it contains no contradictory rules.
- It's not feasible to maintain a unified model for an entire enterprise.
  - We can set about making sure that the parts we want to unify stay that way
  - the parts that are not unified don't cause confusion or corruption.
- We need a way to mark the boundaries and relationships between different models.
  - We choose our strategy consciously and follow it consistently
