# Single Source of Truth

- We often try to keep data (i.e our Domain entities) owned and available from a single source of truth.
  - Common wisdom has it that every domain entity in our enterprise should live in exactly one centralized location. 
  - If you want to fetch an instance of that entity, you go to that location.

> As with much common wisdom, this isn’t necessarily so. It’s a good idea to keep track of where our data resides, sure. But bending over backward to define a single SoT for every piece of data is the wrong approach. At best, it’s often simply not necessary. Worse, it can cause more problems than it purports to solve. In fact, the very notion runs counter to the event-based systems that power many enterprises today. And as we’ll discuss, a true source of truth for our data is, by and large, mythical.
