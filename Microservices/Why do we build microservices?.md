# Why do we build microservices

## First, the bounded context

- 

- There are many technical benefits:

  - Separation of concerns
  - Continous Deployment
  - Decoupling

- ["The true benefits are organisational"](https://betterprogramming.pub/the-truth-about-your-source-of-truth-a1eb833c2d70)

  - Teams have the control and responsibility over their own projects.

  - They can make as many changes to their code as they want to, with little fear of breaking other teams.

  - They can release as frequently as they need, without requiring coordination with any other team. 

  - they own the entire lifecycle of their code, from design and development, to deployment, to production monitoring.

  - > Enforcing a **single source of truth** for our domain entities sabotages those benefits.
