## The Event Storming Approach

Gather the best available brains for the job and collaboratively build a model of a very complex problem space.

- See the system as a whole.
- Find a problem/s worth solving.
- Gather the best immediately available information.
- Start implementing a solution from the best possible starting point.

## Benefits

- Triggers conversations across organisational boundaries.
- Collaboration across multiple disciplines:
  - Business experts
  - Service Designers
  - Software Developers

## Possible formats of Event Storming

### Big Picture

- Good for kicking off a project.
- with every stakeholder involved.
- Avoid focusing too deeply on individual sections.
- Embrace the whole complexity and maximise learning.
- **Knowledge and/or learning is the most valuable outcome.**
- From "[Big Picture Event Storming](https://medium.com/@chatuev/big-picture-event-storming-7a1fe18ffabb)"
  - 
  - In order to discover the domain in-depth and precisely collect the Ubiquitous Language, we need to create a shared pool of business-knowledge

### Design Level

- Digs into possible implementation
- Often DDD-CQRS/ES style
- Fewer, selected people.
- The focus is on implementing software features that are solving a specific problem.

There are others in the book.

## Process

### Phase: Chaotic Exploration

- Domain events (past tense) - `Product added to cart`
- Orange sticky note
- mostly relevant for domain experts
