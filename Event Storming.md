## The Event Storming Approach

Gather the best available brains for the job and collaboratively build a model of a very complex problem space.

- See the system as a whole.
- Find a problem/s worth solving.
- Gather the best immediately available information.
- Start implementing a solution from the best possible starting point.

## Benefits

- Triggers conversations across organisational boundaries.
- Collaboration across multiple disciplines:
  - Business experts
  - Service Designers
  - Software Developers

## Possible formats of Event Storming

## Process

### Phase: Chaotic Exploration

- Domain events (past tense) - `Product added to cart`
- Orange sticky note
- mostly relevant for domain experts
