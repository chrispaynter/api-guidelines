## Start Cooking

- Ensure enough time is given to the discussion in case the answers can be uncovered but if not mark them with a pink Post-It representing the **`Question`** 
- The **``Question``** key will be used very frequently initially, as this is the point with the least collective knowledge of the system.
- When marking an area with the  **``Question``** we are stating that conversation will not be forgotten and can be returned to when needed.

### Once events are captured

- have the teams play through the story from front to back and back to front.
- Add in any missing **`Events`** through the conversation that occurs
- At this stage I like to mark **`Pivot Events`** with some tape coming vertically from a single **`Event`**.
